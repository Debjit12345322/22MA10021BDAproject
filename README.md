# Graph Classification with K100 Detection

This project classifies ego networks extracted from a graph to detect the presence of a K100 clique (complete subgraph of 100 nodes).

## Steps
1. Ego network extraction
2. Node2Vec embedding generation
3. Logistic Regression classification

## Dataset
- Follower-Target network stored in `dataset_final.csv`.

## Output
- graph_classification_K100_report.pdf: Summary report
